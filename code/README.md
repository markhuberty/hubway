We go together: Companionship and cycling in Boston
=============================

Hubway released their data dump for 500,000+ bicycle trips in Boston. What can we learn about where people cycle together, when, and with whom? This code tries to find that out. 

More information on the Hubway data can be found at their [Data Visualization Challenge](hubwaydatachallenge.org) page.
